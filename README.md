# Movie-recomendation-System-using-ML

Introduction:
This is a movie recommendation system that utilizes cosine similarity to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history. Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors. In this case, it is used to measure the similarity between a user's viewing history and other movies in the system.

Usage:
To use the movie recommendation system, a user must first input their viewing history. This can be done by either selecting movies from a list or by inputting movie titles manually. Once the viewing history has been inputted, the system will calculate the cosine similarity between the user's viewing history and all other movies in the system. The system will then suggest the top movies with the highest cosine similarity as recommendations.

Implementation:
The movie recommendation system is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library for calculating cosine similarity. The system uses a dataset of movie titles and their corresponding feature vectors, which are calculated based on the movie's genre and keywords. The feature vectors are normalized to have unit length to ensure that the cosine similarity calculation is accurate.
